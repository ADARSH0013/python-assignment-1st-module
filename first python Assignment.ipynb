    "\n",
    "# Explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for programming\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python's popularity can be attributed to several factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1- python is versatile and flexible.\n",
    "#2- easy to use and learn.\n",
    "#3- python is open source.\n",
    "#4- most importantly, it is used everywhere.\n",
    "#5- functions are defined.\n",
    "#6- Libraries in data science have Python interfaces.\n",
    "#7- Python understands compound data types.\n",

    "# SECOND QUESTION-\n",
    "\n",
    "# Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding. The keyword cannot be used as an identifier,\n",
    "# function, or variable name. All the keywords in Python are written in lowercase except True and False. \n",
    "# In Python, there is an inbuilt keyword module that provides an iskeyword() function that can be used to check\n",
    "# whether a given string is a valid keyword or not. Furthermore, we can check the name of the keywords in Python\n",
    "# by using the kwlist attribute of the keyword module.\n",

    "#EXAMPLE- \n",
    "# and-\tThis is a logical operator which returns true if both the operands are true else returns false.\n",
    "# not-\tThis is again a logical operator it returns True if the operand is false else returns false.\n",
    "# if-\tThis is used to make a conditional statement.\n",
    "# while-\tThis keyword is used to create a while loop.\n",
